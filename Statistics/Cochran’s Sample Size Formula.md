# Cochran’s Sample Size Formula
![formula](https://www.statisticshowto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cochran-1.jpeg)
Where:
*  e is the desired level of precision (for example: the margin of error)
*  p is the (estimated) proportion of the population which has the attribute in question
*  q is 1 – p

## How to calculate
Cochran’s Formula Example
Suppose we are doing a study on the inhabitants of a large town, and want to find out how many households serve breakfast in the mornings. We don’t have much information on the subject to begin with, so we’re going to assume that half of the families serve breakfast: this gives us maximum variability. So p = 0.5. Now let’s say we want 95% confidence, and at least 5 percent—plus or minus—precision. A 95 % confidence level gives us Z values of 1.96, per the normal tables, so we get

((1.96)2 (0.5) (0.5)) / (0.05)2 = 385.

# Cochran’s Sample Size Formula without population standard deviation
Example question: 41% of Jacksonville residents said that they had been in a hurricane. How many adults should be surveyed to estimate the true proportion of adults who have been in a hurricane, with a 95% confidence interval 6% wide?
* Formula: (q*p1*(z/e)**2
  *  e is 6% / 2= 0.06 / 2= 0.03
  *  p is the (estimated) proportion of the population which has the attribute in question here is 41%
  *  q is 1 – p = 0.59
  *  z follows the confidence interval here is 1.960
**Z**
80%	1.282
85%	1.440
90%	1.645
95%	1.960
99%	2.576
99.5%	2.807
99.9%	3.291

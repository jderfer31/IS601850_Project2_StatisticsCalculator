![formula](https://www.statisticshowto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cochran-1.jpeg)
Where:
* e is the desired level of precision (for example: the margin of error)
*  p is the (estimated) proportion of the population which has the attribute in question
*  q is 1 – p

## How to calculate
Cochran’s Formula Example
Suppose we are doing a study on the inhabitants of a large town, and want to find out how many households serve breakfast in the mornings. We don’t have much information on the subject to begin with, so we’re going to assume that half of the families serve breakfast: this gives us maximum variability. So p = 0.5. Now let’s say we want 95% confidence, and at least 5 percent—plus or minus—precision. A 95 % confidence level gives us Z values of 1.96, per the normal tables, so we get

((1.96)2 (0.5) (0.5)) / (0.05)2 = 385.

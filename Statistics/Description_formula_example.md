# Mean:

### Description:
	The "mean" is the "average" you're used to, where you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers. 

### Formula:

	The Mean:
	
         x = ∑x/N
         
Here, ∑ represents the summation X represents scores N represents number of scores.

### Example:

 	3, −7, 5, 13, −2
 	
	The sum of these numbers is 3 − 7 + 5 + 13 − 2 = 12
	There are 5 numbers.
	The mean is equal to 12 ÷ 5 = 2.4
The mean of the above numbers is 2.4

Here is how to do it one line:
Mean = 3 − 7 + 5 + 13 − 25 = 125 = 2.4

# Median:

### Description:
	Median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers. To determine the median value in a sequence of numbers, the 
	numbers must first be sorted, or arranged, in value order from lowest to highest or highest to lowest. The median 
	can be used to determine an approximate average, or mean, but is not to be confused with the actual mean.

### Formula:

If the total number of numbers(n) is an odd number, then the formula is given below:

Median=(n+12)th term

If the total number of the numbers(n) is an even number, then the formula is given below:

Median=(n2)th term+(n2+1)th term2



### Example:

For odd number list:

3, 13, 7, 5, 21, 23, 39, 23, 40, 23, 14, 12, 56, 23, 29

 
When we put those numbers in order we have:
3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 39, 40, 56

 
There are fifteen numbers. Our middle is the eighth number:
3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 39, 40, 56

 
The median value of this set of numbers is 23.

For even number list:

3, 13, 7, 5, 21, 23, 23, 40, 23, 14, 12, 56, 23, 29

 
When we put those numbers in order we have:
3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 40, 56

 
There are now fourteen numbers and so we don't have just one middle number, we have a pair of middle numbers:
3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 40, 56

 
In this example the middle numbers are 21 and 23.

To find the value halfway between them, add them together and divide by 2:
21 + 23 = 44 then 44 ÷ 2 = 22

So the Median in this example is 22.
# Mode:

### Description:

The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears most often.[1] If X is a discrete random variable, the mode is the value x (i.e, X = x) at which the probability mass function takes its maximum value. In other words, it is the value that is most likely to be sampled.

### Formula:

The mode is the most frequently occurring score or value.

### Example:
3, 7, 5, 13, 20, 23, 39, 23, 40, 23, 14, 12, 56, 23, 29

In order these numbers are:
3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 20, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 39, 40, 56

This makes it easy to see which numbers appear most often.

In this case the mode is 23.

# Variance:

### Description:
	Variance (σ2) in statistics is a measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. That is, it measures how 
	far each number in the set is from the mean and therefore from every other number in the set. In investing, the 
	variance of the returns among assets in a portfolio is analyzed as a means of achieving the best asset allocation. 
	The variance equation, in financial terms, is a formula for comparing the performance of the elements of a portfolio 
	against each other and against the mean.

### Formula:
To calculate the variance follow these steps:

Work out the Mean (the simple average of the numbers)

Then for each number: subtract the Mean and square the result (the squared difference).
Then work out the average of those squared differences.




### Example:
It is calculated as the average squared deviation of each number from the mean of a data set.
 
 For example, for the numbers 1, 2, and 3 the mean is 2 and the variance is 0.667.
[(1 - 2)2 + (2 - 2)2 + (3 - 2)2] ÷ 3 = 0.667
[squaring deviation from the mean] ÷ number of observations = variance

# Standard Deviation:
### Description:
The standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean and is calculated as the square root of the variance. It is calculated as the square root of variance by determining the variation between each data point relative to the mean. Standard deviation is a statistical measurement in finance that, when applied to the annual rate of return of an investment, sheds light on the historical volatility of that investment. The greater the standard deviation of securities, the greater the variance between each price and the mean, which shows a larger price range.

### Formula:
​Standard Deviation=n−1∑i=1n​(xi​−x)2​​

where:

xi=Value of the ith point in the data set

x=The mean value of the data set

n=The number of data points in the data set​
 
### Example:
Say we have the data points 5, 7, 3, and 7, which total 22. You would then divide 22 by the number of data points, in this case, four—resulting in a mean of 5.5. This leads to the following determinations: x̄ = 5.5 and N = 4.

The variance is determined by subtracting the value of the mean from each data point, resulting in -0.5, 1.5, -2.5 and 1.5. Each of those values is then squared, resulting in 0.25, 2.25, 6.25 and 2.25. The square values are then added together, resulting in a total of 11, which is then divided by the value of N minus 1, which is 3, resulting in a variance approximately of 3.67.

The square root of the variance is then calculated, which results in a standard deviation measure of approximately 1.915.

Or consider shares of Apple (AAPL) for the last five years. Returns for Apple’s stock were 37.7% for 2014, -4.6% for 2015, 10% for 2016, 46.1% for 2017 and -6.8% for 2018. The average return over the five years is 16.5%.

The value of each year's return less the mean is 21.2%, -21.2%, -6.5%, 29.6%, and -23.3%. All those values are then squared to yield 449.4, 449.4, 42.3, 876.2, and 542.9, respectively. The variance is 590.1, where the squared values are added together and divided by 4 (N minus 1). The square root of the variance is taken to get the standard deviation of 24.3%. 

  
# Z score:
### Description:
A Z-score is a numerical measurement that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. Z-score is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score. A Z-score of 1.0 would indicate a value that is one standard deviation from the mean. Z-scores may be positive or negative, with a positive value indicating the score is above the mean and a negative score indicating it is below the mean.

### Formula:
 z = (x – μ) / σ

### Example:
let’s say you have a test score of 190. 
The test has a mean (μ) of 150 and a standard deviation (σ) of 25. 

Assuming a normal distribution, your z score would be:

•	z = (x – μ) / σ

•	= (190 – 150) / 25 = 1.6.

The z score tells you how many standard deviations from the mean your score is. In this example, your score is 1.6 standard deviations above the mean.


## Random Generators

Random Generators contains many different methods that are intended to produce results in various ways depending upon user's usecase. All random generators methods with seed functionality are intended to hold the random state and can reproduce same result if same seed is provided. However, methods without seed will be completely random and will not allow user to reproduce same result another time.

The first two random methods produces random number between the range of two numbers. The third method generate a list of N random numbers with a seed and between a range of numbers. The 4th and 5th selects random number from list. Finally, the 6th and 7th methods selects N random number from given list.

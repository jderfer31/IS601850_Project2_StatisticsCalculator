# Margin of Error

When one research question is asking of finding a statistical sample mean (or average) , reporting a margin of error, or MOE, for the sample mean have to be done. Furthermore, calculate the margin of error of a sample proportion, which is the amount of “successes” in a sample compared to the raw data. The general formula of the margin of error for the sample mean (assuming a certain condition is met — see below) is
![formula](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/359363.image0.png) is the population standard deviation, **n** is the sample size, and z is z-score (which you can find in the following table).

 **Z**

80%	1.282

85%	1.440

90%	1.645

95%	1.960

99%	2.576

99.5%	2.807

99.9%	3.291
